# Assignment 05: Personas & Scenarios

### Purpose of UX Storytelling in our design
As designers, we would be very limited if we restricted our point of view to merely our own. This is why we view UX storytelling as very important, since it forces us to view the project from multiple users' point of views and gives us insight on how to design around the user before actually interacting with real users. We can think our way through the user's entire process of using a platform from start to finish and try to envision any pain points or struggles that may come about in the process.

### Task Proposal for Toogoodtogo:
Overall scope: Sustainably-wise consumption
* Shop from grocery stores that are signed up to prevent food waste
* Display recipes for dishes that can be made 

type of platform:
helps guide sustainably-wise consumption

they're interested in saving money, so implement a cooking and cheap ingredients section. sells specific ingredients that grocery stores want to get rid of + provide meals that are compatible with said ingredients

# User Scenarios and Journey Maps
## Scenario 1 - Peter

Peter is closely approaching completing his university degree and is drafting his plans to move out on his own. He's been working at his on-campus job quite frequently and is saving up to buy a car soon. Ideally, he would like to cut down the amount of money he spends on dining out and would like for a reliable solution. 

To try and reduce his expenses, he aims to make use of the app Toogoodtogo. He opens the app and sees that there are a few shops open nearby that have open timeslots for pickup. This is great timing since he's had a long day and would like to treat himself but also not spend too much. He realizes that the only options for food pickup are for bakeries and boba shops which leaves him confused since he knows that there are plenty of restaurants that should have leftover food that would otherwise go to waste. This leaves him unsure of what to do since he knows that purchasing food on the platform is sustainably wise but he still wants to feed himself a full meal.

Peter then proceeds to navigate through the "market" feature on the app where grocery stores are allowed to enroll alongside the restaurants and bakeries. This is where he can find specific categories of groceries that the stores would urgently like to sell along with recipes that pertain to those specific bought ingredients. This is perfect for Peter as he's been wanting to cook and save money. This separate functionality of the app allows him to do both of those. He clicks on a nearby market and finds a batch of ingredients for sale. To claim it, he reserves it by clicking the 'checkout' button on the app. To get the food, all he has to do is drive to the store before they close and they keep the bag of food ready for him. He then brings the food home and uses the 'recipes' function on the app to learn how to cook an easy meal with the exact ingredients he purchased.
