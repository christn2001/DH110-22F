# Assignment 05: Personas & Scenarios

### Purpose of UX Storytelling in our design
As designers, we would be very limited if we restricted our point of view to merely our own. This is why we view UX storytelling as very important, since it forces us to view the project from multiple users' point of views and gives us insight on how to design around the user before actually interacting with real users. We can think our way through the user's entire process of using a platform from start to finish and try to envision any pain points or struggles that may come about in the process.
