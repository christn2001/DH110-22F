## Sustainable Consumption project
### Christopher Nott - DH 110 Fall 2022

### Project Description
Sustainable consumption is a concept that deserves to be very prominent in our lives as it contains a very strong hold on the quality of our future. We're very fortunate to have the resources we have and consume, but the consumption of these resources many times comes at a cost. Platforms and resources on sustainable consumption are very effective on providing good information and strategies for the average person to consume in an environmentally-friendly manner
