## Sustainable Consumption project
### Christopher Nott - DH 110 Fall 2022

### Project Description
Sustainable consumption is a concept that deserves to be very prominent in our lives as it contains a very strong hold on the quality of our future. We're very fortunate to have the resources we have and consume, but the consumption of these resources many times comes at a cost. Platforms and resources on sustainable consumption are very effective on providing good information and strategies for the average person to consume in an environmentally-friendly manner


### Platform 1: Toogoodtogo
https://toogoodtogo.com/en-us/consumer

Toogoodtogo(TGTG) is a platform that allows restaurants and customers to collaborate in their sales and purchases. It gives restaurants the ability to notify nearby food buyers if they have stock of food that is reaching its expiration and sell their food at a discounted price. The platform is great for sustainable consumption because it ensures that less food goes to waste and that people in need can obtain food at a lower price.


### Heuristic 1 - Visibility of System Status
This platform does an excellent job with the first heuristic. This first heuristic pays attention to the ability of the platform to keep the user in a higher level of awareness to where they know exactly which state they are in when using the platform. For example, when going on the "Browse" or "discover" page, the options displayed on the page have many cues that the user is currently in a stage of trying to find a restaurant to order from.

### Heuristic 2 - Match between system and the real world
Heuristic 2 involves reaching a collective commonality between term usage on the platform where the users are able to understand the words used in the interface using commonly-used terminology. The concept of the application is based on ordering food and preventing food waste, and the platform does a good job of limiting the term usage in that realm to terminology that is used in regular life.

### Heuristic 3 -User Control and freedom
No matter what the current state of the app is, there is always a way for the user to revert or undo their last action and return to the previous state. Navigating the pages through the four buttons on the bottom is always present and if we select a restaurant option on one of those pages which leads us into a subpage, there is always a back arrow button present on the top left hand corner in case the user wants to undo the action and go back.

### Heuristic 4 - Consistency and Standards 
Toogoodtogo follows industry standards in terms of overall structure of the application and also for terminology. This makes it easy for new users to pick up and learn how to use the app since most of them already will have experience with online shopping/ording food on other apps. There is one new term that is prominent in the platform which is "Surprise Bag" but the terminology is simple enough to the point where the user can easily infer what the meaning of the term is.

### Heuristic 5 - Error Prevention
Since this is a food ordering app, it would be possible to run into an error if we tried to order a surprise bag from a restaurant that was out of stock. The application prevents errors by labeling sold-out deals and greying out these options so that they are no longer selectable as an option. Without this feature, users migh attempt to order food from a restaurant that already ran out of surprise bags which wouldn't be the best outcome

### Heuristic 6 - Recognition over Recall
It's best if user interfaces have a low cognitive load on the user by reducing the amount of items the user must be able to recall from their own memory. TGTG makes sure to always have relevant information displayed in checkout sections. So when viewing a restaurant option, the schedule for pickup is displayed in on the screen there, so that the user doesn't have to think about remembering the exact time to pick up food. In the case that the user forgets when to pick up the food, the scheduled appointment will always be retrievable from the order screen.

### Heuristic 7 - Flexibility and Efficiency of use
Flexibility and customization in interfaces allows for advanced and experienced users to use the platform at a faster speed. This concept takes place in TGTG in the form of the Favorites tab. So instead of having to search for a restaurant from the main page, a experienced user can add a specific restaurant option to their favorites and always have it readily available.

### Heuristic 8 - Aesthetic and Minimalist design
This heuristic aims to have only relevant information concisely displayed to the user as any irrelevant information will end up competing with the information that is actually important to be seen by the users. TGTG is a platform for ordering food and already seems to make sure to not overedo that. The information displayed from the home page all the way to checking out food is very minimalistic and is sure to not provide anything that will distract the user from performing their intended task. 

### Heuristic 9 - Help Users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
It's important that when a user encounters an error that they're informed of what's going on and if they have the ability to recover from it on their own. A very minor error that we can examine on the TGTG app is when they view the Favorites page prior to adding any Favorites options. Clearly, the Favorites feature is unusable without adding any favorites. There is an error message that informs the user of what's going on, stating "No Favorites added yet" then informs the user of how to add favorites to the list.

### Heuristic 10 - Help Documentation 
This is one heuristic where I think the platform is lacking. This Heuristic states that it's good to provide help documentation when needed. There are definitely moments in using this app where help documentation would be useful(defining terminology for first time users).
