##Research Goal
How can we make it easier for mobile phone users to consume food in a sustainably-wise way? In order to do this, it requires that they have the means to do so.
If there is a way users could get access to an index of restaurants/food suppliers that can provide opportunities for sustainably-wise food consumption, that would enable them to achieve responsible consumption.
Currently if someone wishes to do this, there exist some platforms that provide information and opportunities for people to order food online.
However, the amount of platforms and restaurants signed up for them are limited, so the amount of wise-consumption is more limited than we'd like.
Our target user for this research would mostly be people who care for the environment and for the future. Younger people are going to live in this future and they tend to be the ones who care the most about it. I would consider the target audience to be younger adults, ages 18-30.
