# Reinventing Sustainably-wise Food Consumption - Christopher Nott

## Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
The topic category I chose at the beginning of the quarter was sustainable consumption. I ended up doing some research and found an existing platform called TooGoodToGo, which is a mobile application that connects food-buyers and restaurant owners to sell leftovers from the day and prevent food waste. It allows you to pay a small fee (about $5) to reserve a surprise bag from a nearby restaurant. The restaurants put whatever they choose into the surprise bags and the buyers can pick it up whenever available. Restaurants tend to have lots of leftover food items that will end up being thrown away, so this application allows them to lessen the amount of food wasted and increase sales very slightly. Overall, the platform promotes and encourages sustainably-wise consumption by lessening the amount of food waste. My project aims to pick up on the current state of the platform and add features that will put food in the right hands and give indivuals the opportunity to save money and help the environment.

## Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 
The current state of the app is very functional and is already serving the environment well. Many restaurants have enrolled in the platform and have been offering extra food at the end of their operating hours. However, the concept of this application can be expanded to other relevant services as well. Distributing leftovers from restaurants helps greatly on one end of the food market, but if this concept was extrapolated to grocery stores and markets to allow them to distribute leftover ingredients, it could make a great impact on sustainably-wise consumption.

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated
I first completed testing for the 10 Design Heuristics in regards to the TooGoodToGo platform. The 10 heuristics compose different aspects of design that are essential to any kind of interface. After going through this mobile platform and comparing it to these heuristics, I found that it did a very good job following almost all 10 of them. The only thing I noticed was some complicated terminology being used without definitions, but otherwise, the interface is designed well. I also ran usability testing with my sister to see how easily she could make a reservation for a surprise bag and she completed it without many struggles.[Read More(Heuristics)](https://github.com/christn2001/DH110-22F/blob/main/README.md)), [Read More(Pilot UT)](https://github.com/christn2001/DH110-22F/blob/main/Pilot%20UT.md)
