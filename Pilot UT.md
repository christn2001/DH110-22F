My usability test was done on the mobile application Toogoodtogo, a platform meant to build a bridge between businesses and customers allowing leftover food to be purchased at a discounted price before going to waste. Based on our heuristic evaluation, I want to have these three functions of the application included in the usability test: 1. Change location for nearby restaurants, 2. Add and view favorites for restaurants, 3. Make a reservation to purchase food from a restaurant. The restaurant is largely based on familiar applications, but it would be useful to see all of these functions put to use.
