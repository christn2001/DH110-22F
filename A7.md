# Introduction

This part of the design process, creating a high fidelity working prototype, is generally the first step in our design process that combines the visual design with the wireflow aspects of user experience. The high fidelity prototype resembles how the application would actually look in its practical use and is designed to be navigated in its intended way. This interactive prototype allows us to run usability testing, viewing when users are able to understand the interface and also when they run into problems. We can take note of these problems and iterate them, assessing whether or not changes must be made.
