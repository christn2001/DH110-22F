# Introduction

This part of the design process, creating a high fidelity working prototype, is generally the first step in our design process that combines the visual design with the wireflow aspects of user experience. The high fidelity prototype resembles how the application would actually look in its practical use and is designed to be navigated in its intended way. This interactive prototype allows us to run usability testing, viewing when users are able to understand the interface and also when they run into problems. We can take note of these problems and iterate them, assessing whether or not changes must be made.

## Prototype
Here is the link to the working prototype:

The two tasks meant to be completed by this prototype are:
1. Reserve a surprise bag from Food4Less
2. View the newest recipe provided by TooGoodToGo

## Cognitive Walkthrough
I conducted the cognitive walkthrough with one of my close friends. He fits the demographic of someone in the target audience, being a university student that is living on their on and looking to save money with cooking and recipes. During the walkthrough, he ended up completing the two tasks listed above: 1. Reserving a surprise bag from Food4Less and 2. Viewing the newest recipe provided by TooGoodtoGo. The first task went through with minimal errors, with feedback indicating that the design and flow is very straightforward and concise. The second task, however, was not completed as smoothly. Getting to the page with the recipes was easy, but enabling filters was more difficult. I realized that the buttons for each filter were very small and weren't very clear with indicating the function or purpose that each of them serve. This made it difficult for the participant to understand what the current state of the application was and to figure out what to press. It wasn't clear that the buttons for each filter indicated that they served their respective function.

Taking the cognitive runthrough into consideration, I made some slight changes to the interface design. To make the filters easier to comprehend, I changed the color layout for when a specific filter is selected. The newer version shows more contrast from the other buttons than the older version. You can see that as opposed to having a simple outline, the background of the button is altered so that it's easier to tell apart from the others.
