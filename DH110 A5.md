## Purpose of Low-Fidelity prototyping
Creating a low-fidelity prototype is another method of shifting our point of view to the user. It is a method of testing out an interface at an extremely early stage and save time and money in the process. It lets us gain insight from users find problems long before actually creating the fully-functioning platform.

## Description of Project

My project so far has been on Toogoodtogo which is a mobile food-ordering app aiming to prevent food waste and encourage sustainable consumption. I created Personas with demographics based on what I presume the users of this platform would align with. 

* Peter Cunningham, a 21 year old University student from Los Angeles who is looking for cheap food options to provide for himself.
* Rosie Rosenfeld, a 45 year old mother working in Environmental Science research. She cares about the environment and wants her kids to eat healthy.

Tasks for the project:
* Place a grocery order
* Find a recipe to use with your grocery order

## Reflection
This part of the design process was definitely the most fun for me to complete. Seeing ideas come to fruition in the form of a prototype test was very gratifying. I was able to test out the idea of incorporating a new grocery shopping feature on the app and see how it would fit with all of the other features already available. I was worried that having so many different options (restaurants and now groceries) would result in the platform being overall more difficult to navigate. However, it seems like based off of the prototype testing that implementing the grocery section was not too much to offer. For the second task, there were more difficulties in completing the tasks with ambiguous button locations and unclear current states of the platform. Finding the 'recipes' page was rather difficult because of how sectioned off the button was. Choosing a filter also took slightly longer than expected since the participant didn't know which filter was currently being applied before changing it. For changes to the interface, I would want to move the recipes button to a more central location and not have it so hidden. This will make it much easier for users to find and will be a better spot for it considering how vital the feature is to the platform. For the filter, I would simply add a status bar stating which filter is currently being applied to the recipe list so that the user knows what kind of recipe list they are currently looking at.
