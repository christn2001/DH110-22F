## Purpose of Low-Fidelity prototyping
Creating a low-fidelity prototype is another method of shifting our point of view to the user. It is a method of testing out an interface at an extremely early stage and save time and money in the process. It lets us gain insight from users find problems long before actually creating the fully-functioning platform.

## Description of Project

My project so far has been on Toogoodtogo which is a mobile food-ordering app aiming to prevent food waste and encourage sustainable consumption. I created Personas with demographics based on what I presume the users of this platform would align with. 

* Peter Cunningham, a 21 year old University student from Los Angeles who is looking for cheap food options to provide for himself.
* Rosie Rosenfeld, a 45 year old mother working in Environmental Science research. She cares about the environment and wants her kids to eat healthy.

Tasks for the project:
* Place a grocery order
* Find a recipe to use with your grocery order
