## Introduction
My project continues from the research and design based on the platform "toogoodtogo" which connects food-buyers and restaurants to provide food-purchasing opportunities in an effort to prevent food waste and promote sustainable consumption. Last assignment, we left off on completing a wireframe and wireflow for new prospective features of the platform. This time, we narrow down to the visual design elements of the application to try and convert the low-fidelity prototype to a high-fidelity prototype. We define properties for typography, color palette, spacing, and shape variation.

## Typography

For Typography, I'm using fonts from the Poppins family. The contrast font sizes throughout the entire page are not as drastic as usual since I had to keep into account that this is a mobile application and not a desktop platform. There's less space on the small screen, therefore, having very small or large text can either be difficult to read or stick out too much. For the title text, I chose a 16px font size with a medium variation of the font. I also changed the character spacing to -1% to very slightly bring the letters closer together. To me, this made it easier to read the title text. For body text, I chose a 14px font-size with the light variation. For button labels, I chose a 16px font size and the medium variation of the font. I also increased the spacing to 2% since the text looked too compressed when it was inside the button. Lastly I chose 14px font size and regular variation for the subsection buttons at the end. I wanted them to have almost the same amount of 'weight' in the typography compared to the "check out" and "cart" buttons but not quite the same amount, hence the slight decrrease in size.
