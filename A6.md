## Introduction
My project continues from the research and design based on the platform "toogoodtogo" which connects food-buyers and restaurants to provide food-purchasing opportunities in an effort to prevent food waste and promote sustainable consumption. Last assignment, we left off on completing a wireframe and wireflow for new prospective features of the platform. This time, we narrow down to the visual design elements of the application to try and convert the low-fidelity prototype to a high-fidelity prototype. We define properties for typography, color palette, spacing, and shape variation.

## Layout
Doing research on layout, I used a layout grid to divide the screen into 4 total columns. The columns themselves were separated by 10px gutters. The margins are 15px in width which is small due to the lesser amount of pixel space on a mobile screen. In principle, the gutter size is supposed to also represent the ideal amount of space between elements in the frame. With this, I made sure that spacing between the margins and other elements and between buttons were about 10px.

## Typography

For Typography, I'm using fonts from the Poppins family. The contrast font sizes throughout the entire page are not as drastic as usual since I had to keep into account that this is a mobile application and not a desktop platform. There's less space on the small screen, therefore, having very small or large text can either be difficult to read or stick out too much. For the title text, I chose a 16px font size with a medium variation of the font. I also changed the character spacing to -1% to very slightly bring the letters closer together. To me, this made it easier to read the title text. For body text, I chose a 14px font-size with the light variation. For button labels, I chose a 16px font size and the medium variation of the font. I also increased the spacing to 2% since the text looked too compressed when it was inside the button. Lastly I chose 14px font size and regular variation for the subsection buttons at the end. I wanted them to have almost the same amount of 'weight' in the typography compared to the "check out" and "cart" buttons but not quite the same amount, hence the slight decrrease in size.

## Shape Variations

After doing some research on shape variations in UI, one of the main takeaways was that unique shapes will stick out. So without going too far and using unconventional shapes, a shape with unique features in comparison to others around it will inherently be highlighted and noticed easier by the audience. The submenu at he buttom with has straight edges so that it fits with the bottom of the screen. Besides that, I chose to use a unique shape for the 'add to cart' and 'cart' buttons right above it. Since the goal of the design is to have good usability but also to increase the likelihood of a platform's sales, this shape choice to have a value of 30 for rounded edges draws more attention to the buttons leading to checkout. The image of Food4less at the top of the screen has a value of 3 for rounded edges in order to convey a softer and more welcoming look while not being so curved that it sticks out.

## Color Schemes

### Light Mode
Working with different color schemes, the light mode I put together is based off of the original logo colors of the platform with some slight alterations to get a proper score on the color contrast checker

### Dark Mode 

The dark mode is basically the same as light mode but with some darker color choices for the colors that span large parts of the frame

## Impression Test

For the 5-second usability test, I ended up having one of my  close friends partake in it to provide some insight. I briefly showed the high-fidelity frame to him and the adjectives he used to describe the frame were 'friendly', 'business', and 'unclear'. Reflecting on all the work so far, I completely understand how seeing that frame could be unclear without context. I recognize that compared to a landing page for a website, any page of a mobile application will usually not be able to convey as much information as a website.
