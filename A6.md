## Introduction
My project continues from the research and design based on the platform "toogoodtogo" which connects food-buyers and restaurants to provide food-purchasing opportunities in an effort to prevent food waste and promote sustainable consumption. Last assignment, we left off on completing a wireframe and wireflow for new prospective features of the platform. This time, we narrow down to the visual design elements of the application to try and convert the low-fidelity prototype to a high-fidelity prototype. We define properties for typography, color palette, spacing, and shape variation.
